pip install . # install a package in current directory
pip install funniest # install a remote package
pip uninstall funniest

Basic Structure (Clean):
funniest/
    funniest/
        __init__.py
        command_line.py
        tests/
            __init__.py
            test_joke.py
            test_command_line.py
    MANIFEST.in
    README.rst
    setup.py
    .gitignore

Sample Structure:
funniest/
    funniest/ # all python code goes in here
        __init__.py # this is your "main"
		text.py # subdirectory for tests so global namespace isn't polutted
		data.json # just a json file to demonstrate that non-code can go in funniest
		command_line.py # sample file that holds entry point functions
        tests/
            __init__.py
            test_joke.py
			test_command_line
	bin/ # for scripts you want to write that will get copied into path (must be added to setup.py)
		funniest-joke
	docs/ # store documentation
		doc.txt # not sure if this is an actual documentation name
    setup.py # metadata and dependencies Dependencies will be copied from requirements.txt
	requirements.txt  # put all of your dependencies in here (Used in github)
	README.rst # you're readme of course. Used in Pypi and github
    MANIFEST.in # handles non-code files (including README.rst)
	gitignore # put all the files that should get ignored
